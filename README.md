## Food Matcher

Have you ever known who you want to eat with, but not where to eat? This helps a group of 2 or more people to determine the best place to eat. Each person enters in their food preferences, this app suggests places, and the group selection is determined. 

This app works for all types of groups including 
* Couples
* Families 
* Friends 
* Teams 



How it works 

User 1 enters in their food preferences and our app using various APIs to produce a list of possible places to eat. User 1, if they want, select places that like from that list. Then, user 1 sends the page to one or more users. Those users can either enter their preferences or vote on already selected places. After each user, enters their preferences recommendations are updated.
